     * The Sub-Sample Information box is designed to contain sub-sample information.
     * A sub-sample is a contiguous range of bytes of a sample. The specific
     * definition of a sub-sample shall be supplied for a given coding system (e.g.
     * for ISO/IEC 14496-10, Advanced Video Coding). In the absence of such a
     * specific definition, this box shall not be applied to samples using that
     * coding system.
     * The table is sparsely coded; the table identifies which samples have
     * sub-sample structure by recording the difference in sample-number between
     * each entry. The first entry in the table records the sample number of the
     * first sample having sub-sample information.
