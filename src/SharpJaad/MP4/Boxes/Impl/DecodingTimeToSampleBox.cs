    /**
     * This box contains a compact version of a table that allows indexing from
     * decoding time to sample number. Other tables give sample sizes and pointers,
     * from the sample number. Each entry in the table gives the number of
     * consecutive samples with the same time delta, and the delta of those samples.
     * By adding the deltas a complete time-to-sample map may be built.
     * The Decoding Time to Sample Box contains decode time delta's:
     * DT(n+1) = DT(n) + STTS(n)
     * where STTS(n) is the (uncompressed) table entry for sample n.
     * The sample entries are ordered by decoding time stamps; therefore the deltas
     * are all non-negative.
     * The DT axis has a zero origin; DT(i) = SUM(for j=0 to i-1 of delta(j)), and
     * the sum of all deltas gives the length of the media in the track (not mapped
     * to the overall timescale, and not considering any edit list).
     * The Edit List Box provides the initial CT value if it is non-empty
     * (non-zero).
