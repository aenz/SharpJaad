	/**
	 * This optional table answers three questions about sample dependency:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>does this sample depend on others (is it an I-picture)?</li>
	 * <li>do no other samples depend on this one?</li>
	 * <li>does this sample contain multiple (redundant) encodings of the data at
	 * this time-instant (possibly with different dependencies)?</li>
	 * </ul>
	 *
	 * In the absence of this table:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>the sync sample table answers the first question; in most video codecs,
	 * I-pictures are also sync points</li>
	 * <li>the dependency of other samples on this one is unknown</li>
	 * <li>the existence of redundant coding is unknown</li>
	 * </ul>
	 *
	 * When performing 'trick' modes, such as fast-forward, it is possible to use
	 * the first piece of information to locate independently decodable samples.
	 * Similarly, when performing random access, it may be necessary to locate the
	 * previous sync point or random access recovery point, and roll-forward from
	 * the sync point or the pre-roll starting point of the random access recovery
	 * point to the desired point. While rolling forward, samples on which no others
	 * depend need not be retrieved or decoded.
	 * The value of 'sample is depended on' is independent of the existence of
	 * redundant codings. However, a redundant coding may have different
	 * dependencies from the primary coding; if redundant codings are available, the
	 * value of 'sample depends on' documents only the primary coding.
	 *
	 * A Sample Dependency Box may also occur in the Track Fragment Box.
