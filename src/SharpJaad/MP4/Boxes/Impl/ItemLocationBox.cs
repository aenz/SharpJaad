     * The item location box provides a directory of resources in this or other
     * files, by locating their containing file, their offset within that file, and
     * their length. Placing this in binary format enables common handling of this
     * data, even by systems which do not understand the particular metadata system
     * (handler) used. For example, a system might integrate all the externally
     * referenced metadata resources into one file, re-adjusting file offsets and
     * file references accordingly.
     *
     * Items may be stored fragmented into extents, e.g. to enable interleaving. An
     * extent is a contiguous subset of the bytes of the resource; the resource is
     * formed by concatenating the extents. If only one extent is used then either
     * or both of the offset and length may be implied:
     * <ul>
     * <li>If the offset is not identified (the field has a length of zero), then
     * the beginning of the file (offset 0) is implied.</li>
     * <li>If the length is not specified, or specified as zero, then the entire
     * file length is implied. References into the same file as this metadata, or
     * items divided into more than one extent, should have an explicit offset and
     * length, or use a MIME type requiring a different interpretation of the file,
     * to avoid infinite recursion.</li>
     * 
     * The size of the item is the sum of the extent lengths.
     *
     * The data-reference index may take the value 0, indicating a reference into
     * the same file as this metadata, or an index into the data-reference table.
     *
     * Some referenced data may itself use offset/length techniques to address
     * resources within it (e.g. an MP4 file might be 'included' in this way).
     * Normally such offsets are relative to the beginning of the containing file.
     * The field 'base offset' provides an additional offset for offset calculations
     * within that contained data. For example, if an MP4 file is included within a
     * file formatted to this specification, then normally data-offsets within that
     * MP4 section are relative to the beginning of file; the base offset adds to
     * those offsets.
